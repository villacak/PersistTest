PersistTest
===========

This is an example where I have tested two of those most used data persistence used in Android.

I have used simple SQL statements, and ContentValues that is basically a map.

Please feel free to test it on Android from earlier versions up to the last, update or fork it.

A good way to test it would be lock the table when inserting and unlock it once it has finished. This will inprove

the speed for insert rows into a table.

The project was created on Android Studio v0.5.1 though it's easy to migrate to ADT (Eclipse).
